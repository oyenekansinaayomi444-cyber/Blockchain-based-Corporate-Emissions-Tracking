# 🌍 Blockchain-based Corporate Emissions Tracking

Welcome to a revolutionary system for immutable tracking of corporate emissions on the Stacks blockchain! This Web3 project addresses the real-world problem of opaque and manipulable emissions reporting, which hinders compliance with international climate agreements like the Paris Agreement. By leveraging blockchain's transparency and immutability, companies can securely log emissions data, automate compliance reports, and enable verifiable audits—reducing fraud, streamlining regulatory processes, and fostering trust among stakeholders.

## ✨ Features

📊 Immutable emissions logging with timestamps and hashes  
✅ Automated generation of compliance reports based on global standards  
🔍 Third-party auditing and verification tools  
🏆 Integration with carbon credit tokens for offset tracking  
⚖️ Governance mechanisms for updating emission standards  
📈 Historical data querying for trend analysis  
🚨 Penalty and alert system for non-compliance  
🔒 Secure company registration and role-based access  

## 🛠 How It Works

This project is built using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain. It involves 8 interconnected smart contracts to handle various aspects of emissions tracking and compliance. Here's a high-level overview:

### Smart Contracts Overview
1. **CompanyRegistry.clar**: Manages company registrations, including verification of corporate identities and assignment of unique IDs.  
2. **EmissionsLogger.clar**: Allows registered companies to log emissions data (e.g., CO2 equivalents) with timestamps and cryptographic hashes for immutability.  
3. **StandardsGovernance.clar**: A DAO-style contract for proposing and voting on updates to emission calculation standards (e.g., aligning with IPCC guidelines).  
4. **ComplianceReporter.clar**: Automates the generation of reports by aggregating logged data and checking against predefined thresholds for international agreements.  
5. **AuditorVerifier.clar**: Enables certified auditors to review and verify emissions data, stamping approvals on-chain.  
6. **CarbonCreditToken.clar**: An STX-based fungible token (using SIP-010 standard) for tracking carbon offsets and credits earned through reductions.  
7. **PenaltyEnforcer.clar**: Triggers alerts or on-chain penalties (e.g., token burns) for detected non-compliance based on report outputs.  
8. **DataQuery.clar**: Provides read-only functions for querying historical emissions data, trends, and compliance history without modifying the ledger.

**For Companies**  
- Register your company via `CompanyRegistry` by submitting proof-of-identity (e.g., a hashed certificate).  
- Log emissions periodically using `EmissionsLogger`, providing data like scope 1/2/3 emissions with supporting hashes.  
- Use `ComplianceReporter` to generate automated reports—call `generate-report` with your company ID to get a compliance score and exportable data.  
- Offset emissions by minting or trading credits through `CarbonCreditToken`.  

**For Regulators and Auditors**  
- Verify company data using `AuditorVerifier`—call `audit-emissions` to review logs and add verification stamps.  
- Monitor compliance via `PenaltyEnforcer`, which automatically flags issues based on reports.  
- Query aggregated trends with `DataQuery` for oversight, e.g., `get-emissions-history` for a company's timeline.  

**For Stakeholders (e.g., Investors or NGOs)**  
- Access public reports and verifications through read functions in `ComplianceReporter` and `DataQuery`.  
- Participate in governance votes via `StandardsGovernance` to influence standards updates.  

Boom! Emissions data is now transparently tracked, reports are automated, and compliance is enforceable—all on an immutable blockchain.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repo and deploy the Clarity contracts to a Stacks testnet. Use tools like Clarinet for local development and testing. Ensure you handle STX transactions for gas fees during registrations and logs.

This system not only solves reporting inefficiencies but also incentivizes sustainable practices through tokenized credits, making climate compliance more accessible and trustworthy worldwide!
